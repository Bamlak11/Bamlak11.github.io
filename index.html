  <h1>Walking</h1>
  <p1>Day 1: I took a walk in my neighborhood with my brother. We walked for about 20-30 minutes. While we were walking we encountered people, pets, birds, and other things. This walk made me realize how nice it is to enjoy nature and not be on the phone for a long time.</p1>


	<p2>Day 2: I walked by myself around a lake by my house. I’ve encountered people jogging, walking, and running. I also see people swimming and playing volleyball. It’s a very sunny day and you can see people having a good time with their families.</p2>


	<p3>Day 3: I drove down to Minneapolis with my friend to take a walk in the golden arch bridge. I think it’s been a year since I’ve been here but the view was amazing. My friend and I mainly talked about life and encountered many people riding scooters, riding bikes, and just jogging. We had a great view of the river and the buildings downtown. Walking the bridge felt like a long-distance but had a very good time.</p3>

<p4>Walk 4: Today I went to a park in Woodbury with friends walked for around 15 minutes and enjoyed the warm weather, then we started playing some basketball. By the end of this, I was very tired and my legs were starting to hurt.</p4>
